### GenomicSeqProcessor
This repository contains a Python program to construct reverse, complement, and reverse-complement sequences for DNA and RNA. This tool is essential for genomic studies and can handle genome data sourced from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). The project was guided and leverages the Spyder IDE for development.

### Features

- **Reverse Sequence Generation**: Create reverse sequences of DNA/RNA.
- **Complement Sequence Generation**: Generate complement sequences of DNA/RNA.
- **Reverse-Complement Sequence Generation**: Construct reverse-complement sequences of DNA/RNA.

### Background

Coronavirus is an RNA virus with a single-stranded RNA genome. For accurate genome retrieval, biologists use the reverse transcriptase enzyme to generate complementary DNA (cDNA). This project aims to facilitate the retrieval of such genomic data by providing necessary sequence transformations.

### Installation

To use this tool, clone the repository and ensure you have Python installed along with the Spyder IDE.
